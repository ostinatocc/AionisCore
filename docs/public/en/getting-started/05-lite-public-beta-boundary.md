# Lite Public Beta Boundary

This page defines what Aionis Lite public beta is, what it supports, and what it does not promise.

Read this before treating Lite as your default deployment profile.

## Positioning

Aionis Lite public beta is:

1. a single-user local runtime
2. a SQLite-backed edition of the Aionis kernel
3. the fastest path to local memory, replay, and context workflows

Aionis Lite public beta is not:

1. a production replacement for Server
2. a multi-user team control plane
3. a promise of Server parity

## Supported In Lite Public Beta

The current supported Lite beta surface is:

1. `npm run start:lite`
2. `/health`
3. `/v1/memory/write`
4. `/v1/memory/recall`
5. `/v1/memory/recall_text`
6. `/v1/memory/planning/context`
7. `/v1/memory/context/assemble`
8. replay lifecycle and playbooks:
   - `run/start`
   - `step/before`
   - `step/after`
   - `run/end`
   - `runs/get`
   - `playbooks/get`
   - `playbooks/candidate`
   - `playbooks/run`
   - `playbooks/dispatch`
   - `playbooks/compile_from_run`
   - `playbooks/promote`
   - `playbooks/repair`
   - `playbooks/repair/review`
9. sessions/events
10. packs export/import
11. graph inspection:
   - `find`
   - `resolve(node|edge|commit|decision)`
12. policy loop:
   - `rules/evaluate`
   - `tools/select`
   - `tools/decision`
   - `tools/run`
   - `tools/feedback`

Additional constraints:

1. `/v1/memory/write` still requires `input_text` or `input_sha256` in the minimum valid request
2. Lite supporting these routes does not imply identical visibility semantics across every lane and inspection surface

## Intentionally Server-Only

This outer surface remains intentionally unavailable in Lite:

1. `/v1/admin/control/*`

In Lite, it is expected to return:

1. `501 server_only_in_lite`

Treat that as edition behavior, not as a runtime failure.

## Local Automation Subset

Lite now includes a local automation subset instead of treating the whole automation namespace as unavailable.

Currently supported:

1. `/v1/automations/create`
2. `/v1/automations/get`
3. `/v1/automations/list`
4. `/v1/automations/validate`
5. `/v1/automations/graph/validate`
6. `/v1/automations/run`
7. `/v1/automations/runs/get`
8. `/v1/automations/runs/list`
9. `/v1/automations/runs/cancel`
10. `/v1/automations/runs/resume`

Unsupported automation routes now return:

1. `501 automation_feature_not_supported_in_lite`

## What Lite Beta Promises

Lite beta currently promises:

1. a real local startup path
2. a local SQLite-backed kernel path
3. repeatable dogfood validation through `npm run -s lite:dogfood`
4. repository gates for alpha and beta-candidate posture

Lite beta does not currently promise:

1. multi-user coordination
2. hosted governance workflows
3. production HA topology
4. Server-level scaling or operational guarantees

## Who Should Use Lite Beta

Lite beta is best for:

1. single developers
2. local agent runtime experiments
3. IDE and MCP integrations
4. replay and memory workflow prototyping
5. evaluating Aionis without Docker + Postgres

Use Server instead if you need:

1. team governance
2. admin/control plane routes
3. full automation governance and reviewer workflows
4. production traffic
5. shared operational ownership

## Recommended Lite Beta Validation

Minimum path:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run build
npm run start:lite
```

Health:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/health | jq '{ok,runtime,storage,lite}'
```

Canonical validation:

```bash
npm run -s lite:dogfood
```

Expected health:

1. `runtime.edition = "lite"`
2. `storage.backend = "lite_sqlite"`

## Known Operator Edges

These are known Lite beta operator edges, not release blockers:

1. Lite requires Node `22+` because of `node:sqlite`
2. `memory_lane = "private"` should not be read as “hidden everywhere”
3. in the current Lite beta, `find` is stricter for private lane visibility while `recall_text` / context paths may still surface private content
4. pack routes are local Lite routes and no longer require an admin token
5. successful writes may return `lite_embedding_backfill_completed_inline`

1. [Lite Operator Notes](/public/en/getting-started/04-lite-operator-notes)

## Escalation Rule

If your workflow needs any of the following, move to Server rather than trying to stretch Lite:

1. shared tenant governance
2. automation orchestration
3. operator recovery and alerting surfaces
4. production deployment guarantees

## Current Release Posture

Current posture is:

1. internal alpha completed
2. repository beta-candidate gates passing
3. suitable for controlled public beta evaluation

It is not yet positioned as:

1. GA
2. default deployment mode
3. production-recommended topology
