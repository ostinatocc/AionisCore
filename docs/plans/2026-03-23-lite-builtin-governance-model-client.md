Document status: historical implementation plan

1. Add builtin governance model-client implementations for `promote_memory` and `form_pattern`.
2. Extend the shared model-client factory with a `builtin` mode.
3. Switch the provider factory to request builtin clients for current model-backed paths.
4. Add direct builtin client coverage.
5. Verify targeted governance tests, `tsc`, and `test:lite`.
