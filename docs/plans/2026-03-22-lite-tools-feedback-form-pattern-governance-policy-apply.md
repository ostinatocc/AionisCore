# Lite Tools Feedback Form-Pattern Governance Policy Apply Plan

Date: 2026-03-22

## Steps

1. Extend pattern trust-hardening and decision-trace schemas for runtime apply.
2. Add a narrow governed anchor-state override helper to `tools-pattern-anchor`.
3. Let `tools/feedback` pass the effective `stable` override into anchor persistence when policy effect applies.
4. Extend tests to verify returned and persisted anchor state after admissible high-confidence review.
5. Update governance status and run targeted plus full Lite validation.
