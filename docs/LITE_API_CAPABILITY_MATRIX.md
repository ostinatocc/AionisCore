# Aionis API Capability Matrix

Last reviewed: 2026-03-20

This document records the current public API surface of the standalone `Aionis` repository.

Named execution-memory mainline:

`Anchor-Guided Rehydration Loop`

Definition:

`stable execution -> workflow anchor -> recall -> runtime hint -> optional rehydration`

Named execution-policy loop:

`Execution Policy Learning Loop`

Definition:

`feedback -> pattern -> recall -> selector reuse`

It is intentionally stricter than the full runtime. When a surface is not part of Aionis, the host should either:

1. not register it at all, or
2. return a structured `501`

Primary routing sources:

1. `src/host/http-host.ts`
2. `src/host/lite-edition.ts`
3. `src/routes/*.ts`

## Status Legend

Endpoint status labels used below:

1. `Supported`
   The route is registered in Lite and intended for normal use.
2. `Supported (Subset)`
   The route group exists in Lite, but only a reduced Lite-local subset is available.
3. `Conditional`
   The route is available only when the relevant Lite config is enabled.
4. `Unsupported (501)`
   The route or route group is intentionally unavailable in Lite and returns a structured `501`.

## Stable System Surface

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Supported | Stable Lite health contract with `runtime`, `storage`, `lite`, and `sandbox` envelopes. |

## Memory Write And Handoff

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/write` | Supported | Primary local memory write path. |
| `POST` | `/v1/handoff/store` | Supported | Local handoff persistence. |
| `POST` | `/v1/handoff/recover` | Supported | Local handoff recovery. |

## Memory Access, Sessions, Packs, Find, Resolve

This is one of Lite's `Supported (Subset)` surfaces. The following routes are present:

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/sessions` | Supported | Create a local session graph root. |
| `GET` | `/v1/memory/sessions` | Supported | List sessions. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/events` | Supported | Append a session event. |
| `GET` | `/v1/memory/sessions/:session_id/events` | Supported | List events for a session. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/packs/export` | Supported | Local pack export; no admin token required in Lite. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/packs/import` | Supported | Local pack import; no admin token required in Lite. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/find` | Supported | Local graph/search lookup. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/resolve` | Supported | Local node resolution. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/execution/introspect` | Supported | Demo/introspection surface for execution memory. Aggregates workflow/pattern signals, maintenance summaries, and demo-ready text in one local response. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/anchors/rehydrate_payload` | Supported | Anchor-linked payload rehydration by id or URI. In Lite, omitted `actor` defaults to the local actor identity, so private local anchors remain directly rehydratable through the normal single-user path. |

## Recall And Context Runtime

This route group is one half of the `Anchor-Guided Rehydration Loop`.
It serves the `recall -> runtime hint` portion of the loop.

Planner-packet contract:

1. `planning_context` and `context_assemble` now expose a stable `planner_packet`
2. the packet sections are:
   1. `recommended_workflows`
   2. `candidate_workflows`
   3. `candidate_patterns`
   4. `trusted_patterns`
   5. `contested_patterns`
   6. `rehydration_candidates`
   7. `supporting_knowledge`
3. both routes also expose canonical `pattern_signals` and `workflow_signals`
4. `planning_summary` and `execution_kernel` expose `action_packet_summary`, and `execution_kernel` also exposes `pattern_signal_summary` and `workflow_signal_summary`
5. `planner_explanation` now follows packet order and explains workflow guidance, pattern trust, rehydration availability, and supporting knowledge append behavior
6. lower-level `context.items` and `citations` may now expose `summary_kind`, `execution_kind`, `anchor_kind`, and `compression_layer` so planner-facing consumers can distinguish action memory from supporting knowledge without re-parsing raw slots
7. heavy recall substrate and demo-facing aggregation have moved to `POST /v1/memory/execution/introspect`

Recommended integrator read path:

1. prefer `planner_packet.sections.*` for full workflow/pattern/rehydration collections
2. read `workflow_signals` and `pattern_signals` directly as canonical signal surfaces
3. read `planning_summary` / `assembly_summary` and `execution_kernel` for compact aligned state

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/recall` | Supported | Core Lite recall path. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/recall_text` | Supported | Context-runtime text recall. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/planning/context` | Supported | Planning-context assembly. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/context/assemble` | Supported | Final context assembly route. |

## Feedback, Rules, And Tool Selection

The tooling surface now also supports the `Execution Policy Learning Loop`, the local tool-memory loop that grows pattern anchors from validated tool outcomes.

Selector rule:

1. explicit rule/policy `tool.prefer` stays ahead of recalled trusted patterns
2. trusted patterns can still refine ordering after explicit preference, but they do not override explicit operator or rule intent
3. `selection_summary.provenance_explanation` now uses the same trust language family as `planner_explanation`
4. the selection surface can therefore explicitly say whether a trusted pattern supported the selected tool, was available but not used, or was visible but not trusted

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/feedback` | Supported | Local rule-feedback write path. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/rules/state` | Supported | Update local rule state. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/rules/evaluate` | Supported | Evaluate Lite rules. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/tools/select` | Supported | Local tool-selection decision path. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/tools/decision` | Supported | Fetch a tool decision. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/tools/run` | Supported | Fetch one tool run lifecycle. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/tools/runs/list` | Supported | List tool runs. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/tools/rehydrate_payload` | Supported | Runtime-friendly tool alias for anchor payload rehydration inside the `Anchor-Guided Rehydration Loop`. The normal Lite path inherits the default local actor, so planner/runtime hints can call it without restating identity. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/tools/feedback` | Supported | Store tool-selection feedback and distill validated tool outcomes into local pattern anchors. |

## Replay And Playbook Core

The replay kernel is present in Lite and is one of the major product subsystems.
It is also the producer side of the `Anchor-Guided Rehydration Loop`, where stable executions become workflow anchors.

Producer rule:

1. newly promoted stable playbooks are written as workflow anchors
2. if the latest playbook is already `shadow` or `active`, Lite normalizes that same latest node into a workflow anchor instead of leaving pre-anchor stable versions behind

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/run/start` | Supported | Start a replay run. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/step/before` | Supported | Record pre-step state. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/step/after` | Supported | Record post-step state. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/run/end` | Supported | End a replay run. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/runs/get` | Supported | Fetch one replay run. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/compile_from_run` | Supported | Compile a playbook from a replay run. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/get` | Supported | Fetch a playbook. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/candidate` | Supported | Candidate evaluation path. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/promote` | Supported | Promote a playbook version. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/repair` | Supported | Repair a playbook definition. |

## Governed Replay And Playbook Execution

This is a `Supported (Subset)` surface in Lite. The Lite routes are local-only and do not imply the full server governance model.

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/repair/review` | Supported (Subset) | Lite keeps endpoint-scoped repair review behavior, not tenant-scoped control-plane overlays. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/run` | Supported (Subset) | Local playbook execution path. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/replay/playbooks/dispatch` | Supported (Subset) | Local dispatch path. |

## Lite Automation Kernel

Lite automation is intentionally a local playbook-driven kernel, not the full server orchestration surface.

Supported definition and run routes:

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/create` | Supported | Create a Lite automation definition. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/get` | Supported | Fetch one definition. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/list` | Supported | List Lite automation definitions. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/validate` | Supported | Validate a Lite automation payload. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/graph/validate` | Supported | Graph validation alias. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/run` | Supported | Run a Lite automation graph. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/runs/get` | Supported | Fetch one run. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/runs/list` | Supported | List runs. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/runs/cancel` | Supported | Cancel a paused or active run where allowed. |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/runs/resume` | Supported | Resume approval-gated Lite runs. |

Supported node kinds:

1. `playbook`
2. `approval`
3. `condition`
4. `artifact_gate`

Unsupported governance/orchestration routes:

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/automations/assign_reviewer` | Unsupported (501) | Returns `automation_feature_not_supported_in_lite`. |

| `POST` | `/v1/automations/telemetry` | Unsupported (501) | Returns `automation_feature_not_supported_in_lite`. |

## Sandbox

Sandbox is available in Lite and is now enabled by default for ordinary local users.

Runtime notes:

1. default mode is still `mock`
2. `npm run start:lite:local-process` enables the narrow `local_process_echo` preset
3. if `SANDBOX_ADMIN_ONLY=true`, the sandbox routes still require the admin token
4. if `SANDBOX_ENABLED=false`, sandbox routes return a structured `400`

Supported sandbox routes:

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/sandbox/sessions` | Conditional | Available when `SANDBOX_ENABLED=true`. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/sandbox/execute` | Conditional | Sync and async execution entrypoint. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/sandbox/runs/get` | Conditional | Fetch one run. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/sandbox/runs/logs` | Conditional | Fetch stdout/stderr logs. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/sandbox/runs/artifact` | Conditional | Fetch one declared artifact. |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/sandbox/runs/cancel` | Conditional | Cancel a queued or active run. |

## Explicitly Unsupported Lite Route Groups

These route groups are intentionally owned by the full/server runtime and return `server_only_in_lite`.

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ALL` | `/v1/admin/control/*` | Unsupported (501) | Admin/control-plane surface stays outside the standalone Aionis repository. |
| `ALL` | `/v1/memory/archive/rehydrate*` | Unsupported (501) | Archive lifecycle restore is not implemented in Lite. |
| `ALL` | `/v1/memory/nodes/activate*` | Unsupported (501) | Node lifecycle activation is not implemented in Lite. |

## Practical Product Boundary

The current Aionis API shape means:

1. Aionis is fully usable for local memory, replay, playbook, automation, sandbox, handoff, and pack flows.
2. Aionis is intentionally not a control-plane product.
3. Aionis automation is intentionally a local execution kernel, not a multi-tenant orchestration platform.
4. If a route is missing from this document, it should be treated as non-contractual until explicitly added.
