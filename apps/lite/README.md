# Aionis Lite Wrapper

This directory owns the Lite app launcher for the standalone `Aionis Lite` repository.

Current state:

1. It owns the Lite app wrapper entrypoint and startup script.
2. It launches the root Lite source runtime through `tsx`.
3. It keeps Lite startup behavior isolated from the shared runtime tree.

Current commands:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/lite run build
npm --prefix apps/lite run start
npm --prefix apps/lite run start:print-env
```

Current runtime model:

1. root `src/index.ts` is the Lite runtime source entrypoint
2. `apps/lite/src/index.js` is the Lite app launcher
3. `apps/lite/scripts/start-lite-app.sh` owns Lite startup behavior
4. root `scripts/start-lite.sh` remains a compatibility shim

Default local identity:

1. Lite startup exports `LITE_LOCAL_ACTOR_ID=local-user` unless overridden
2. replay/playbook routes use that actor when no auth principal is present
3. automation runs also fall back to that actor, so playbook-driven flows work without extra identity payloads

Useful override:

```bash
LITE_LOCAL_ACTOR_ID=lucio npm --prefix apps/lite run start
```
